# hysteresis-paths

Compute hysteresis paths for a given network. See the Jupyter notebooks for examples of how to compute and read the data.

This code computes all paths and return the ones that are hysteretic. It is intended to be used only for small networks since the number of paths for larger networks can be extremely large.
